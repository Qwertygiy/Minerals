/* Gabbro is an intrusive igneous rock, formed when magma rich in iron and magnesium
 * cools slowly beneath the earth's surface. The same magma, if cooled on the surface,
 * would form basalt instead. Gabbro is sometimes referred to as "black granite", although
 * it is only similar to granite in appearance, not composition or origin.
