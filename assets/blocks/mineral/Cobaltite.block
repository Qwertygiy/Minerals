/**
 * Cobaltite is a mineral composed mainly of cobalt, arsenic, and sulfur, that may contain
 * up to 10 percent iron, and variable amounts of nickel. The name comes from the German word
 * "Kobold", for "underground spirit", as it is notoriously difficult to smelt cobalt out of its ores
 * in traditional manners.
