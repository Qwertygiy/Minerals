/**
 * Kimberlite is the most important source of diamond gems in the world. It is formed when
 * magma deep within the mantle explodes upwards in a carrot-shaped intrusion. Because it is
 * formed at such a depth, it often carries with it gems such as diamond and garnet, which
 * can only form at high pressures.
