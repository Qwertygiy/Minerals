/**
 * Lignite is brown coal, more compressed than peat but less compressed than bituminous coal.
 * Like all forms of coal, it is the result of trees millions of years ago that were buried
 * intact, such as in a swamp or bog, and then slowly being reduced to carbon under the pressure
 * of the rock above.
