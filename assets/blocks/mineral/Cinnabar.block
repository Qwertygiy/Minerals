 * Cinnabar (mercury sulfide) is toxic to human beings. It has been prized since antiquity because
 * it has a rich red color, known as vermillion, and can be easily ground up into paint.
 * It was often used in royal burial chambers, and before it was known to cause mercury poisoning,
 * was commonly used as makeup such as lipstick and rouge.
