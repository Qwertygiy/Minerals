/**
 * Many bismuth alloys are relatively soft and malleable. Malleable means that a metal
 * can be hammered into thin sheets. Bismuth is alloyed with iron to create
 * what is known as "malleable irons."
 *
 * Bismuth compounds are used in stomach-upset medicines, treatment of stomach ulcers,
 * soothing creams, and cosmetics.
