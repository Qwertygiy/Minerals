/**
 * Graphite is a mineral found in certain metamorphic layers of rock. Graphite may be considered
 * the highest grade of coal, as it is pure carbon. Graphite is also commonly used in the form of powders.
 * Graphite may be flammable on contact with magma, but will never melt, meaning torches mixed
 * with graphite would be an excellent long-burning flame.
