 * Corundum is a extremely hard mineral made primarily of aluminum oxide, and occurs in many colors,
 * either as shapeless grains or as rhombohedral crystals. It also occurs in gem varieties,
 * such as ruby and sapphire, or dark-colored varieties that are used for polishing and scraping.
 * Corundum is found in igneous and carbonate rocks. This is the yellow variety.
